Hi, I am Xiongsheng Wang(王雄盛).

- I am a full-time programmer.
- Outside of work I play badminton and read novels.
- Currently I am studying service mesh and FaaS.
- If you have a little heat, you can give a little light,
just like a firefly, you can give a little light in the darkness without waiting for a torch.
After that, if there is no torch, I am the only light.
(有一分热，发一分光，就令萤火一般，也可以在黑暗里发一点光，不必等候炬火。此后如竟没有炬火，我便是唯一的光。)
